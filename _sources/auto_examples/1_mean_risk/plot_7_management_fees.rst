Management Fees
===============

This tutorial shows how to incorporate management fees (MF) into the 
:class:`~skfolio.optimization.MeanRisk` optimization.

By using The `management_fees` parameter, you can add linear MF to the optimization 
problem:

.. math:: total\_fee = \sum_{i=1}^{N} f_{i} \times w_{i}

with :math:`f_{i}` the management fee of asset i and :math:`w_{i}` its weight.
The float :math:`total\_fee` is impacting the portfolio expected return in the optimization:

.. math:: expected\_return = \mu^{T} \cdot w - total\_fee

with :math:`\mu` the vector af assets expected returns and :math:`w` the vector of 
assets weights.

The `management_fees` parameter can be a float, a dictionary or an array-like of
shape `(n_assets, )`. If a float is provided, it is applied to each asset.
If a dictionary is provided, its (key/value) pair must be the (asset name/asset MF) and
the input `X` of the `fit` method must be a DataFrame with the assets names in
columns. The default is 0.0 (no management fees).

.. note::

    Another approach is to direcly impact the MF to the input `X` in order to express 
    the returns net of fee. However, when estimating the :math:`\mu` parameter using,
    for example, Shrinkage estimators, this approach would mix a deterministic amount
    with an uncertain one leading to unwanted bias in the management fees.

Data
====
We load the S&P 500 :ref:`dataset <datasets>` composed of the daily prices of 20
assets from the S&P 500 Index composition starting from 1990-01-02 up to 2022-12-28.
We select only 3 assets to make the example more readable, which are Apple (AAPL),
General Electric (GE) and JPMorgan (JPM).

Model
=====
In this tutorial, we will use the Maximum Mean-Variance Utility model with a risk
aversion of 1.0:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 63-67

.. code-block:: Python

    model = MeanRisk(objective_function=ObjectiveFunction.MAXIMIZE_UTILITY)
    model.fit(X)
    model.weights_

Management Fees
===============
Management fees are usually used in assets under management but for this example we
will assume that it also applies for the below stocks:

  * Apple: 3% p.a.
  * General Electric: 6% p.a.
  * JPMorgan: 1% p.a.

The MF are expressed in per annum, so we need to convert them in daily MF.
We suppose 252 trading days in a year:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 79-89

.. code-block:: Python

    management_fees = {"AAPL": 0.03 / 252, "GE": 0.06 / 252, "JPM": 0.01 / 252}
    # Same as management_fees = np.array([0.03, 0.06, 0.01]) / 252

    model_mf = MeanRisk(
        objective_function=ObjectiveFunction.MAXIMIZE_UTILITY,
        management_fees=management_fees,
    )
    model_mf.fit(X)
    model_mf.weights_





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none


    array([5.74787861e-01, 1.43028265e-08, 4.25212125e-01])



.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 90-91

The higher MF of Apple induced a change of weights toward JPMorgan:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 91-93

    model_mf.weights_ - model.weights_





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

    array([-4.29453703e-02,  1.05150748e-08,  4.29453598e-02])



.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 94-98

Multi-period portfolio
======================
Let's assume that we want to rebalance our portfolio every 60 days by re-fitting the
model on the latest 60 days. We test the impact of MF using Walk Forward Analysis:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 98-102

.. code-block:: Python

    holding_period = 60
    fitting_period = 60
    cv = WalkForward(train_size=fitting_period, test_size=holding_period)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 103-104

As explained above, we transform the yearly MF into a daily MF:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 104-106

.. code-block:: Python

    management_fees = np.array([0.03, 0.06, 0.01]) / 252








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 107-110

First, we train the model without MF and test it with MF.
Note that `portfolio_params` are parameters passed to the Portfolio during `predict`
and **not** during `fit`:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 110-118

.. code-block:: Python

    model = MeanRisk(
        objective_function=ObjectiveFunction.MAXIMIZE_UTILITY,
        portfolio_params=dict(management_fees=management_fees),
    )
    # pred1 is a MultiPeriodPortfolio
    pred1 = cross_val_predict(model, X, cv=cv, n_jobs=-1)
    pred1.name = "pred1"








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 119-120

Then, we train and test the model with MF:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 120-124

.. code-block:: Python

    model.set_params(management_fees=management_fees)
    pred2 = cross_val_predict(model, X, cv=cv, n_jobs=-1)
    pred2.name = "pred2"








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 125-127

We visualize the results by plotting the cumulative returns of the successive test
periods:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 127-131

.. code-block:: Python

    population = Population([pred1, pred2])
    fig = population.plot_cumulative_returns()
    show(fig)

We notice that the model **fitted with MF** outperform the model **fitted without
MF**.
