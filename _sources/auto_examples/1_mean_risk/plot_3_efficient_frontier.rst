==================
Efficient Frontier
==================

This tutorial uses the :class:`~skfolio.optimization.MeanRisk` optimization to find an
ensemble of portfolios belonging to the Mean-Variance efficient frontier (pareto font).

Data
====
We load the S&P 500 :ref:`dataset <datasets>` composed of the daily prices of 20
assets from the S&P 500 Index composition starting from 1990-01-02 up to 2022-12-28:

Model
=====
We create the Mean-Variance model and then fit it on the training set.
The parameter `efficient_frontier_size=30` is used to find 30 portfolios on the entire
efficient frontier:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 36-44

.. code-block:: Python

    model = MeanRisk(
        risk_measure=RiskMeasure.VARIANCE,
        efficient_frontier_size=30,
        portfolio_params=dict(name="Variance"),
    )
    model.fit(X_train)
    print(model.weights_.shape)

    (30, 20)




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 45-50

Prediction
==========
We predict this model on both the training set and the test set.
The `predict` method returns the :class:`~skfolio.population.Population` of
30 :class:`~skfolio.portfolio.Portfolio`:

    population_train = model.predict(X_train)
    population_test = model.predict(X_test)

Analysis
========
For improved analysis, we add a "Train" and "Test" tag to the portfolios and
concatenate the training and the test populations:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 58-71

.. code-block:: Python

    population_train.set_portfolio_params(tag="Train")
    population_test.set_portfolio_params(tag="Test")

    population = population_train + population_test

    fig = population.plot_measures(
        x=RiskMeasure.ANNUALIZED_VARIANCE,
        y=PerfMeasure.ANNUALIZED_MEAN,
        color_scale=RatioMeasure.ANNUALIZED_SHARPE_RATIO,
        hover_measures=[RiskMeasure.MAX_DRAWDOWN, RatioMeasure.ANNUALIZED_SORTINO_RATIO],
    )

Instead of providing `efficient_frontier_size=30`, you can also provide an array of
lower bounds for the expected returns using `min_return`. In the below example, we
find the 5 portfolios that minimize the variance under a minimum return constraint of
15%, 20%, 25%, 30% and 35% (annualized):
