Mean-Variance-CDaR Surface
==========================

This tutorial uses the :class:`~skfolio.optimization.MeanRisk` optimization to find an
ensemble of portfolios belonging to the Mean-Variance-CDaR efficient frontier.

Data

We load the S&P 500 :ref:`dataset <datasets>` composed of the daily prices of 20
assets from the S&P 500 Index composition starting from 2015-01-05 up to 2022-12-28:

Model
=====
First, we create a Maximum Sharpe Ratio model that we fit on the training set:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 35-42

.. code-block:: Python

    model = MeanRisk(
        risk_measure=RiskMeasure.VARIANCE,
        objective_function=ObjectiveFunction.MAXIMIZE_RATIO,
    )
    portfolio = model.fit_predict(X_train)
    print(portfolio.cdar)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    0.1700238781664583




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 43-48

Let's assume that we are not satisfied with the CDaR (Conditional Drawdown at Risk)
of 17% corresponding to the maximum Sharpe portfolio. We want to analyze alternative
portfolios that maximize the Sharpe under CDaR constraints.
To have an idea of the feasible CDaR constraints, we analyze the Minimum CDaR
portfolio:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 48-52

.. code-block:: Python

    model = MeanRisk(risk_measure=RiskMeasure.CDAR)
    portfolio = model.fit_predict(X_train)
    print(portfolio.cdar)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    0.09718550832245015




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 53-56

The minimum CDaR is 9.72%.
Now we find the pareto optimal portfolios that maximizes the Sharpe under CDaR
constraint ranging from 9.72% to 17%:

.. code-block:: Python

    model = MeanRisk(
        risk_measure=RiskMeasure.VARIANCE,
        objective_function=ObjectiveFunction.MAXIMIZE_RATIO,
        max_cdar=np.linspace(start=0.0972, stop=0.17, num=10),
    )
    model.fit(X_train)
    print(model.weights_.shape)

Analysis
==========
We predict this model on both the training set and the test set to analyze the
deformation of the efficient frontier:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 69-84

.. code-block:: Python

    population_train = model.predict(X_train)
    population_test = model.predict(X_test)

    population_train.set_portfolio_params(tag="Train")
    population_test.set_portfolio_params(tag="Test")

    population = population_train + population_test

    population.plot_measures(
        x=RiskMeasure.CDAR,
        y=RatioMeasure.ANNUALIZED_SHARPE_RATIO,
        color_scale=RatioMeasure.ANNUALIZED_SHARPE_RATIO,
        hover_measures=[RiskMeasure.MAX_DRAWDOWN, RatioMeasure.ANNUALIZED_SORTINO_RATIO],
    )

Pareto Optimal Surface
======================
Instead of analyzing the Sharpe-CDaR efficient frontier, we can analyze the
mean-Variance-CDaR pareto optimal surface:
