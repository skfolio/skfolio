==================
Weight Constraints
==================

This tutorial shows how to incorporate weight constraints into the
:class:`~skfolio.optimization.MeanRisk` optimization.

We will show how to use the below parameters:
    * min_weights
    * max_weights
    * budget
    * min_budget
    * max_budget
    * max_short
    * max_long
    * linear_constraints
    * groups
    * left_inequality
    * right_inequality

Data
====
We load the S&P 500 :ref:`dataset <datasets>` composed of the daily prices of 20
assets from the S&P 500 Index composition starting from 1990-01-02 up to 2022-12-28.
We select only 3 assets to make the example more readable, which are Apple (AAPL),
General Electric (GE) and JPMorgan (JPM):

    prices = load_sp500_dataset()
    prices = prices[["AAPL", "GE", "JPM"]]

    X = prices_to_returns(prices)

Model
=====
In this tutorial, we will use a Minimum Variance model.
By default,  :class:`~skfolio.optimization.MeanRisk` is long only (`min_weights=0`)
and fully invested (`budget=1`). In other terms, all weights are positive and sum to
one.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 50-55

.. code-block:: Python

    model = MeanRisk()
    model.fit(X)
    print(sum(model.weights_))

    array([0.22768876, 0.56566507, 0.20664617])



.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 56-67

Budget
======
The budget is the sum of long positions and short positions (sum of all weights).
It can be `None` or a float. `None` means that there are no budget constraints.
The default is `1.0` (fully invested).

Examples:

  * budget = 1    –> fully invested portfolio
  * budget = 0    –> market neutral portfolio
  * budget = None –> no constraints on the sum of weights

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 67-73

.. code-block:: Python


    model = MeanRisk(budget=0.5)
    model.fit(X)
    print(sum(model.weights_))

    0.5

    array([0.11391513, 0.28246101, 0.10362386])



.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 74-78

You can also set a constraint on the minimum and maximum budget using `min_budget`
and `max_budget`, which are the lower and upper bounds of the sum of long and short
positions (sum of all weights). The default is `None`. If provided, you must set
`budget=None`.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 78-83

.. code-block:: Python

    model = MeanRisk(budget=None, min_budget=0.3, max_budget=0.5)

Lower and Upper Bounds on Weights
=================================
The weights lower and upper bounds are controlled by the parameters `min_weights` and
`max_weights` respectively.
You can provide `None`, a float, an array-like or a dictionary.
`None` is equivalent to `-np.Inf` (no lower bounds).
If a float is provided, it is applied to each asset.
If a dictionary is provided, its (key/value) pair must be the (asset name/asset
weight bound) and the input `X` of the `fit` method must be a DataFrame with the
assets names in columns.
The default values are `min_weights=0.0` (no short selling) and `max_weights=1.0`
(each asset is below 100%). When using a dictionary, you don't have to provide
constraints for all assets. If not provided, the default values (0.0 for min_weights
and 1.0 for max_weights) will be assigned to the assets not specified in the
dictionary.

.. note ::

  When incorporating a pre-selection transformer into a Pipeline, using a list for
  weight constraints is not feasible, as we don't know in advance which assets will
  be selected by the pre-selection process. This is where the dictionary proves
  useful.

Example:
  * min_weights = 0                     –> long only portfolio (no short selling).
  * min_weights = None                  –> no lower bound (same as -np.Inf).
  * min_weights = -2                    –> each weight must be above -200%.
  * min_weights = [0, -2, 0.5]          –> "AAPL", "GE" and "JPM" must be above 0%, -200% and 50% respectively.
  * min_weights = {"AAPL": 0, "GE": -2} -> "AAPL", "GE" and "JPM"  must be above 0%, -200% and 0% (default) respectively.
  * max_weights = 0                     –> no long position (short only portfolio).
  * max_weights = None                  –> no upper bound (same as +np.Inf).
  * max_weights = 2                     –> each weight must be below 200%.
  * max_weights = [1, 2, -0.5]          -> "AAPL", "GE" and "JPM"  must be below 100%, 200% and -50% respectively.
  * max_weights = {"AAPL": 1, "GE": 2}  -> "AAPL", "GE" and "JPM"  must be below 100%, 200% and 100% (default).

Let's create the same model as above but using partial dictionary:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 144-149

.. code-block:: Python

    model = MeanRisk(min_weights={"GE": 0.5, "JPM": 0.1})

Short and Long Position Constraints
===================================
Constraints on the upper bound for short and long positions can be set using
`max_short` and `max_long`. The short position is defined as the sum of negative
weights (in absolute term) and the long position as the sum of positive weights.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 164-166

Let's create a fully invested long-short portfolio model with a total short position
less than 50%:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 172-188

Group and Linear Constraints
============================
We can assign groups to each asset using the `groups` parameter and set
constraints on these groups using the `linear_constraint` parameter.
The `groups` parameter can be a 2D array-like or a dictionary. If a dictionary is
provided, its (key/value)  pair must be the (asset name/asset groups).
You can reference these groups and/or the asset names in `linear_constraint`, which
is a list if strings following the below patterns:

  * "2.5 * ref1 + 0.10 * ref2 + 0.0013 <= 2.5 * ref3"
  * "ref1 >= 2.9 * ref2"
  * "ref1 <= ref2"
  * "ref1 >= ref1"

Let's create a model with groups constraints on "industry sector" and
"capitalization":

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 188-207

.. code-block:: Python

    groups = {
        "AAPL": ["Technology", "Mega Cap"],
        "GE": ["Industrial", "Big Cap"],
        "JPM": ["Financial", "Big Cap"],
    }
    # You can also provide a 2D array-like:
    # groups = [["Technology", "Industrial", "Financial"], ["Mega Cap", "Big Cap", "Big Cap"]]
    linear_constraints = [
        "Technology + 1.5 * Industrial <= 2 * Financial",  # First group
        "Mega Cap >= 0.75 * Big Cap",  # Second group
        "Technology >= Big Cap",  # Mix of first and second groups
        "Mega Cap >= 2 * JPM",  # Mix of groups and assets
    ]
    # Note that only the first constraint would be sufficient in that case.

    model = MeanRisk(groups=groups, linear_constraints=linear_constraints)
    model.fit(X)
    model.weights_

Left and Right Inequalities
===========================
Finally, you can also directly provide the matrix :math:`A` and the vector
:math:`b` of the linear constraint :math:`A \cdot w \leq b`:
