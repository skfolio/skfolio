#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.
<!--
A clear and concise description of what you have implemented.
-->

#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?

<!--
Only relevant if you changed pyproject.toml.
We try to minimize dependencies in the core dependency set.
-->

#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?

<!-- This section is particularly useful if you have a pull request that is still in development. You can guide the reviews to focus on the parts that are ready for their comments. We suggest using bullets (indicated by * or -) and filled checkboxes [x] here -->

#### Did you add any tests for the change?

<!-- This section is useful if you have added a test in addition to the existing ones. This will ensure that further changes to these files won't introduce the same kind of bug. It is considered good practice to add tests with newly added code to enforce the fact that the code actually works. This will reduce the chance of introducing logical bugs.

#### Any other comments?
<!--
We value all user contributions, no matter how small or complex they are. Please feel free to any additional comments.

##### For all contributions
- [ ] The PR title starts with either [ENH], [MNT], [DOC], or [BUG]. [BUG] - bugfix, [MNT] - CI, test framework, [ENH] - adding or improving code, [DOC] - writing or improving documentation or docstrings.
- [ ] Optionally, I've added myself and possibly others to the [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/skfolio/skfolio/blob/main/CODEOWNERS) file - do this if you want to become the owner or maintainer of an estimator you added.

##### For new estimators
- [ ] I've added the estimator to the API reference in `docs/api.rst`.
- [ ] I've added one or more illustrative usage examples to the docstring and the `examples` section.
