### Implement Features

Look through the GitHub issues for features. Anything tagged with "enhancement" and "help wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

### Write Documentation

skfolio could always use more documentation, whether as part of the official docs, in docstrings, or even on the tutorials.

### Submit Feedback

The best way to send feedback is via [our issue page][gh-issues] on GitHub. If you are proposing a feature:

- Explain in detail how it would work.
- Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
- Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions are welcome ðŸ˜Š

## Get Started!

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set yourself up for local development.

1. Fork the repo on GitHub.

2. Clone your fork locally:

   ```shell
   $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/skfolio.git
   ```

3. Install the project in development mode with the development dependencies:

   Using **pip**:
   ```shell
   $ pip install --editable ".[dev]"
   ```

   or using **uv**:
   ```shell
   $ uv pip install -r pyproject.toml --editable . --extra dev
   ```

4. Create a branch for local development:

   ```shell
   $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
   ```
   Now you can make your changes locally.

   To name your branch, you can use the convention: 
   `category/reference/description-in-kebab-case`
   with category: `feature`, `fix`, `refactor`, `chore` and reference: 
   `issue-<issue number>` or `no-ref`. For example: `feature/issue-34/factor-model`


5. Add unit tests for your implementation and check that your changes pass all tests:

   Using **pip**:
   ```shell
   $ pytest
   ```
   or using **uv**:
   ```shell
   $ uv run pytest
   ```

6. Then run linting and formatting checks with:

   Using **pip**:
   ```shell
   $ ruff check
   $ ruff format --check
   ```
   or using **uv**:
   ```shell
   $ uv run ruff check
   $ uv run ruff format --check
   ```
   
   To fix linting and formatting issues, you can run:
   
   Using **pip**:
   ```shell
   $ ruff check --fix
   $ ruff format
   ```
   or using **uv**:
   ```shell
   $ uv run ruff check --fix
   $ uv run ruff format
   ```

7. If you added some documentation, you should test that it builds correctly:
   
   Using **pip**:
   ```shell
   $ pip install --editable ".[docs]"
   $ cd docs
   $ sphinx-build . _build
   ```
   or using **uv**:
   ```shell
   $ uv pip install -r pyproject.toml --editable . --extra docs
   $ cd docs
   $ uv run sphinx-build . _build
   ```

8. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:

   ```shell
   $ git add .
   $ git commit -m "feat(something): your detailed description of your changes"
   $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
   ```

   Note: the commit message should follow [the conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org).
 

9. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website or using the GitHub CLI:

   ```shell
   $ gh pr create --fill
   ```


## Pull Request Guidelines

We like to have the pull request open as soon as possible, that's a great place to discuss any piece of work, even unfinished. You can use draft pull request if it's still a work in progress. Here are a few guidelines to follow:

1. Include tests for feature or bug fixes.
2. Update the documentation for significant features.
3. Ensure tests are passing on CI.
