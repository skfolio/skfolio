class MaximumDiversification(MeanRisk):
    r"""Maximum Diversification Optimization estimator.

    Maximizes the diversification ratio which is the ratio of the weighted volatilities
    over the total volatility.

    It is a special case of the :class:`~skfolio.optimization.MeanRisk` estimator where
    the expected return from the objective function is replaced by the weighted
    volatilities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    prior_estimator : BasePrior, optional
        :ref:`Prior estimator <prior>`.
        The prior estimator is used to estimate the :class:`~skfolio.prior.PriorModel`
        containing the estimation of assets expected returns, covariance matrix,
        returns and Cholesky decomposition of the covariance.
        The default (`None`) is to use :class:`~skfolio.prior.EmpiricalPrior`.

    min_weights : float | dict[str, float] | array-like of shape (n_assets, ) | None, default=0.0
        Minimum assets weights (weights lower bounds).
        If a float is provided, it is applied to each asset.
        `None` is equivalent to `-np.Inf` (no lower bound).
        If a dictionary is provided, its (key/value) pair must be the
        (asset name/asset minium weight) and the input `X` of the `fit` method must
        be a DataFrame with the assets names in columns.
        When using a dictionary, assets values that are not provided are assigned
        a minimum weight of `0.0`.
        The default value is `0.0` (no short selling).

        Example:

           * `min_weights = 0` --> long only portfolio (no short selling).
           * `min_weights = None` --> no lower bound (same as `-np.Inf`).
           * `min_weights = -2` --> each weight must be above -200%.
           * `min_weights = {"SX5E": 0, "SPX": -2}`
           * `min_weights = [0, -2]`

    max_weights : float | dict[str, float] | array-like of shape (n_assets, ) | None, default=1.0
        Maximum assets weights (weights upper bounds).
        If a float is provided, it is applied to each asset.
        `None` is equivalent to `+np.Inf` (no upper bound).
        If a dictionary is provided, its (key/value) pair must be the
        (asset name/asset maximum weight) and the input `X` of the `fit` method must
        be a DataFrame with the assets names in columns.
        When using a dictionary, assets values that are not provided are assigned
        a minimum weight of `1.0`.
        The default value is `1.0` (each asset is below 100%).

        Example:

           * `max_weights = 0` --> no long position (short only portfolio).
           * `max_weights = None` --> no upper bound.
           * `max_weights = 2` --> each weight must be below 200%.
           * `max_weights = {"SX5E": 1, "SPX": 2}`
           * `max_weights = [1, 2]`

    budget : float | None, default=1.0
        Investment budget. It is the sum of long positions and short positions (sum of
        all weights). `None` means no budget constraints.
        The default value is `1.0` (fully invested portfolio).

        Examples:

             * `budget = 1` --> fully invested portfolio.
             * `budget = 0` --> market neutral portfolio.
             * `budget = None` --> no constraints on the sum of weights.

    min_budget : float, optional
        Minimum budget. It is the lower bound of the sum of long and short positions
        (sum of all weights). If provided, you must set `budget=None`.
        The default (`None`) means no minimum budget constraint.

    max_budget :  float, optional
        Maximum budget. It is the upper bound of the sum of long and short positions
        (sum of all weights). If provided, you must set `budget=None`.
        The default (`None`) means no maximum budget constraint.

    max_short : float, optional
        Maximum short position. The short position is defined as the sum of negative
        weights (in absolute term).
        The default (`None`) means no maximum short position.

    max_long : float, optional
        Maximum long position. The long position is defined as the sum of positive
        weights.
        The default (`None`) means no maximum long position.

    transaction_costs : float | dict[str, float] | array-like of shape (n_assets, ), default=0.0
        Transaction costs of the assets. It is used to add linear transaction costs to
        the optimization problem:

        .. math:: total\_cost = \sum_{i=1}^{N} c_{i} \times |w_{i} - w\_prev_{i}|

        with :math:`c_{i}` the transaction cost of asset i, :math:`w_{i}` its weight
        and :math:`w\_prev_{i}` its previous weight (defined in `previous_weights`).
        The float :math:`total\_cost` is impacting the portfolio expected return in the optimization:

        .. math:: expected\_return = \mu^{T} \cdot w - total\_cost

        with :math:`\mu` the vector af assets' expected returns and :math:`w` the
        vector of assets weights.

        If a float is provided, it is applied to each asset.
        If a dictionary is provided, its (key/value) pair must be the
        (asset name/asset cost) and the input `X` of the `fit` method must be a
        DataFrame with the assets names in columns.
        The default value is `0.0`.

        .. warning::

            Based on the above formula, the periodicity of the transaction costs
            needs to be homogenous to the periodicity of :math:`\mu`. For example, if
            the input `X` is composed of **daily** returns, the `transaction_costs` need
            to be expressed as **daily** costs.
            (See :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_1_mean_risk_plot_6_transaction_costs.py`)

    management_fees : float | dict[str, float] | array-like of shape (n_assets, ), default=0.0
        Management fees of the assets. It is used to add linear management fees to the
        optimization problem:

        .. math:: total\_fee = \sum_{i=1}^{N} f_{i} \times w_{i}

        with :math:`f_{i}` the management fee of asset i and :math:`w_{i}` its weight.
        The float :math:`total\_fee` is impacting the portfolio expected return in the optimization:

        .. math:: expected\_return = \mu^{T} \cdot w - total\_fee

        with :math:`\mu` the vector af assets expected returns and :math:`w` the vector
        of assets weights.

        If a float is provided, it is applied to each asset.
        If a dictionary is provided, its (key/value) pair must be the
        (asset name/asset fee) and the input `X` of the `fit` method must be a
        DataFrame with the assets names in columns.
        The default value is `0.0`.

        .. warning::

            Based on the above formula, the periodicity of the management fees needs to
            be homogenous to the periodicity of :math:`\mu`. For example, if the input
            `X` is composed of **daily** returns, the `management_fees` need to be
            expressed in **daily** fees.

        .. note::

            Another approach is to directly impact the management fees to the input `X`
            in order to express the returns net of fees. However, when estimating the
            :math:`\mu` parameter using for example Shrinkage estimators, this approach
            would mix a deterministic value with an uncertain one leading to unwanted
            bias in the management fees.

    previous_weights : float | dict[str, float] | array-like of shape (n_assets, ), optional
        Previous weights of the assets. Previous weights are used to compute the
        portfolio cost and the portfolio turnover.
        If a float is provided, it is applied to each asset.
        If a dictionary is provided, its (key/value) pair must be the
        (asset name/asset previous weight) and the input `X` of the `fit` method must
        be a DataFrame with the assets names in columns.
        The default (`None`) means no previous weights.

    l1_coef : float, default=0.0
        L1 regularization coefficient.
        It is used to penalize the objective function by the L1 norm:

        .. math:: l1\_coef \times \Vert w \Vert_{1} = l1\_coef \times \sum_{i=1}^{N} |w_{i}|

        Increasing this coefficient will reduce the number of non-zero weights
        (cardinality). It tends to increase robustness (out-of-sample stability) but
        reduces diversification.
        The default value is `0.0`.

    l2_coef : float, default=0.0
        L2 regularization coefficient.
        It is used to penalize the objective function by the L2 norm:

        .. math:: l2\_coef \times \Vert w \Vert_{2}^{2} = l2\_coef \times \sum_{i=1}^{N} w_{i}^2

        It tends to increase robustness (out-of-sample stability).
        The default value is `0.0`.

    linear_constraints : array-like of shape (n_constraints,), optional
        Linear constraints.
        The linear constraints must match any of following patterns:

           * "2.5 * ref1 + 0.10 * ref2 + 0.0013 <= 2.5 * ref3"
           * "ref1 >= 2.9 * ref2"
           * "ref1 <= ref2"
           * "ref1 >= ref1"

        With "ref1", "ref2" ... the assets names or the groups names provided
        in the parameter `groups`. Assets names can be referenced without the need of
        `groups` if the input `X` of the `fit` method is a DataFrame with these
        assets names in columns.

        Examples:

            * "SPX >= 0.10" --> SPX weight must be greater than 10% (note that you can also use `min_weights`)
            * "SX5E + TLT >= 0.2" --> the sum of SX5E and TLT weights must be greater than 20%
            * "US >= 0.7" --> the sum of all US weights must be greater than 70%
            * "Equity <= 3 * Bond" --> the sum of all Equity weights must be less or equal to 3 times the sum of all Bond weights.
            * "2*SPX + 3*Europe <= Bond + 0.05" --> mixing assets and group constraints

    groups : dict[str, list[str]] or array-like of shape (n_groups, n_assets), optional
        The assets groups referenced in `linear_constraints`.
        If a dictionary is provided, its (key/value) pair must be the
        (asset name/asset groups) and the input `X` of the `fit` method must be a
        DataFrame with the assets names in columns.

        Examples:

            * groups = {"SX5E": ["Equity", "Europe"], "SPX": ["Equity", "US"], "TLT": ["Bond", "US"]}
            * groups = [["Equity", "Equity", "Bond"], ["Europe", "US", "US"]]

    left_inequality : array-like of shape (n_constraints, n_assets), optional
        Left inequality matrix :math:`A` of the linear
        constraint :math:`A \cdot w \leq b`.

    right_inequality : array-like of shape (n_constraints, ), optional
        Right inequality vector :math:`b` of the linear
        constraint :math:`A \cdot w \leq b`.

    risk_free_rate : float, default=0.0
        Risk-free interest rate.
        The default value is `0.0`.

    max_tracking_error : float, optional
        Upper bound constraint on the tracking error.
        The tracking error is defined as the RMSE (root-mean-square error) of the
        portfolio returns compared to a target returns. If `max_tracking_error` is
        provided, the target returns `y` must be provided in the `fit` method.

    max_turnover : float, optional
        Upper bound constraint of the turnover.
        The turnover is defined as the absolute difference between the portfolio weights
        and the `previous_weights`. Note that another way to control for turnover is by
        using the `transaction_costs` parameter.

    min_return : float | array-like of shape (n_optimization), optional
        Lower bound constraint on the expected return.

    min_return : float | array-like of shape (n_optimization), optional
        Lower bound constraint on the expected return.

    add_objective : Callable[[cp.Variable], cp.Expression], optional
        Add a custom objective to the existing objective expression.
        It is a function that must take as argument the weights `w` and returns a
        CVXPY expression.

    add_constraints : Callable[[cp.Variable], cp.Expression|list[cp.Expression]], optional
        Add a custom constraint or a list of constraints to the existing constraints.
        It is a function that must take as argument the weights `w` and returns a
        CVPXY expression or a list of CVPXY expressions.

    solver : str, default="CLARABEL"
        The solver to use. The default is "CLARABEL" which is written in Rust and has
        better numerical stability and performance than ECOS and SCS. Cvxpy will replace
        its default solver "ECOS" by "CLARABEL" in future releases.

    solver_params : dict, optional
        Solver parameters. For example, `solver_params=dict(verbose=True)`.
        The default (`None`) is use `{"tol_gap_abs": 1e-9, "tol_gap_rel": 1e-9}`
        for the solver "CLARABEL" and the CVXPY default otherwise.
