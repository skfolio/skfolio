class HierarchicalRiskParity(BaseHierarchicalOptimization):
    r"""Hierarchical Risk Parity estimator.

    Hierarchical Risk Parity is a portfolio optimization method developed by Marcos
    Lopez de Prado [2]_.

    This algorithm uses a distance matrix to compute hierarchical clusters using the
    Hierarchical Tree Clustering algorithm. It then employs seriation to rearrange the
    assets in the dendrogram, minimizing the distance between leafs.

    The final step is the recursive bisection where each cluster is split between two
    sub-clusters by starting with the topmost cluster and traversing in a top-down
    manner. For each sub-cluster, we compute the total cluster risk of an inverse-risk
    allocation. A weighting factor is then computed from these two sub-cluster risks,
    which is used to update the cluster weight.

    .. note ::
        The original paper uses the variance as the risk measure and the single-linkage
        method for the Hierarchical Tree Clustering algorithm. Here we generalize it to
        multiple risk measures and linkage methods.
        The default linkage method is set to the Ward
        variance minimization algorithm, which is more stable and has better properties
        than the single-linkage method [4]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    risk_measure : RiskMeasure or ExtraRiskMeasure, default=RiskMeasure.VARIANCE
        :class:`~skfolio.meta.RiskMeasure` or :class:`~skfolio.meta.ExtraRiskMeasure`
        of the optimization.
        Can be any of:

            * MEAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATION
            * FIRST_LOWER_PARTIAL_MOMENT
            * VARIANCE

            * WORST_REALIZATION
            * CDAR
            * MAX_DRAWDOWN
            * AVERAGE_DRAWDOWN
            * EDAR

            * FOURTH_LOWER_PARTIAL_MOMENT
            * SKEW
            * KURTOSIS

        The default is `RiskMeasure.VARIANCE`.

    prior_estimator : BasePrior, optional
        :ref:`Prior estimator <prior>`.
        The prior estimator is used to estimate the :class:`~skfolio.prior.PriorModel`
        containing the estimation of assets expected returns, covariance matrix and
        returns. The moments and returns estimations are used for the risk computation
        and the returns estimation are used by the distance matrix estimator.
        The default (`None`) is to use :class:`~skfolio.prior.EmpiricalPrior`.

    distance_estimator : BaseDistance, optional
        :ref:`Distance estimator <distance>`.
        The distance estimator is used to estimate the codependence and the distance
        matrix needed for the computation of the linkage matrix.
        The default (`None`) is to use :class:`~skfolio.distance.PearsonDistance`.

    hierarchical_clustering_estimator : HierarchicalClustering, optional
        :ref:`Hierarchical Clustering estimator <hierarchical_clustering>`.
        The hierarchical clustering estimator is used to compute the linkage matrix
        and the hierarchical clustering of the assets based on the distance matrix.
        The default (`None`) is to use
        :class:`~skfolio.cluster.HierarchicalClustering`.

    min_weights : float | dict[str, float] | array-like of shape (n_assets, ), default=0.0
        Minimum assets weights (weights lower bounds). Negative weights are not allowed.
        If a float is provided, it is applied to each asset. `None` is equivalent to
        `-np.Inf` (no lower bound). If a dictionary is provided, its (key/value) pair
        must be the (asset name/asset minium weight) and the input `X` of the `fit`
        methods must be a DataFrame with the assets names in columns. When using a
        dictionary, assets values that are not provided are assigned a minimum weight
        of `0.0`. The default is 0.0 (no short selling).

        Example:

           * min_weights = 0 --> long only portfolio (no short selling).
           * min_weights = None --> no lower bound (same as `-np.Inf`).
           * min_weights = {"SX5E": 0, "SPX": 0.1}
           * min_weights = [0, 0.1]

    max_weights : float | dict[str, float] | array-like of shape (n_assets, ), default=1.0
        Maximum assets weights (weights upper bounds). Weights above 1.0 are not
        allowed. If a float is provided, it is applied to each asset. `None` is
        equivalent to `+np.Inf` (no upper bound). If a dictionary is provided, its
        (key/value) pair must be the (asset name/asset maximum weight) and the input `X`
        of the `fit` method must be a DataFrame with the assets names in columns. When
        using a dictionary, assets values that are not provided are assigned a minimum
        weight of `1.0`. The default is 1.0 (each asset is below 100%).

        Example:

           * max_weights = 0 --> no long position (short only portfolio).
           * max_weights = 0.5 --> each weight must be below 50%.
           * max_weights = {"SX5E": 1, "SPX": 0.25}
           * max_weights = [1, 0.25]

    transaction_costs : float | dict[str, float] | array-like of shape (n_assets, ), default=0.0
        Transaction costs of the assets. It is used to add linear transaction costs to
        the optimization problem:

        .. math:: total\_cost = \sum_{i=1}^{N} c_{i} \times |w_{i} - w\_prev_{i}|

        with :math:`c_{i}` the transaction cost of asset i, :math:`w_{i}` its weight
        and :math:`w\_prev_{i}` its previous weight (defined in `previous_weights`).
        The float :math:`total\_cost` is impacting the portfolio expected return in the optimization:

        .. math:: expected\_return = \mu^{T} \cdot w - total\_cost

        with :math:`\mu` the vector af assets' expected returns and :math:`w` the
        vector of assets weights.

        If a float is provided, it is applied to each asset.
        If a dictionary is provided, its (key/value) pair must be the
        (asset name/asset cost) and the input `X` of the `fit` method must be a
        DataFrame with the assets names in columns.
        The default value is `0.0`.

        .. warning::

            Based on the above formula, the periodicity of the transaction costs
            needs to be homogenous to the periodicity of :math:`\mu`. For example, if
            the input `X` is composed of **daily** returns, the `transaction_costs` need
            to be expressed as **daily** costs.
            (See :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_1_mean_risk_plot_6_transaction_costs.py`)

    management_fees : float | dict[str, float] | array-like of shape (n_assets, ), default=0.0
        Management fees of the assets. It is used to add linear management fees to the
        optimization problem:

        .. math:: total\_fee = \sum_{i=1}^{N} f_{i} \times w_{i}

        with :math:`f_{i}` the management fee of asset i and :math:`w_{i}` its weight.
        The float :math:`total\_fee` is impacting the portfolio expected return in the optimization:

        .. math:: expected\_return = \mu^{T} \cdot w - total\_fee

        with :math:`\mu` the vector af assets expected returns and :math:`w` the vector
        of assets weights.

        If a float is provided, it is applied to each asset.
        If a dictionary is provided, its (key/value) pair must be the
        (asset name/asset fee) and the input `X` of the `fit` method must be a
        DataFrame with the assets names in columns.
        The default value is `0.0`.

        .. warning::

            Based on the above formula, the periodicity of the management fees needs to
            be homogenous to the periodicity of :math:`\mu`. For example, if the input
            `X` is composed of **daily** returns, the `management_fees` need to be
            expressed in **daily** fees.

        .. note::

            Another approach is to directly impact the management fees to the input `X`
            in order to express the returns net of fees. However, when estimating the
            :math:`\mu` parameter using for example Shrinkage estimators, this approach
            would mix a deterministic value with an uncertain one leading to unwanted
            bias in the management fees.

    previous_weights : float | dict[str, float] | array-like of shape (n_assets, ), optional
        Previous weights of the assets. Previous weights are used to compute the
        portfolio total cost. If a float is provided, it is applied to each asset.
        If a dictionary is provided, its (key/value) pair must be the
        (asset name/asset previous weight) and the input `X` of the `fit` method must
        be a DataFrame with the assets names in columns.
        The default (`None`) means no previous weights.

    portfolio_params :  dict, optional
        Portfolio parameters passed to the portfolio evaluated by the `predict` and
        `score` methods. If not provided, the `name`, `transaction_costs`,
        `management_fees` and `previous_weights` are copied from the optimization
        model and systematically passed to the portfolio.
