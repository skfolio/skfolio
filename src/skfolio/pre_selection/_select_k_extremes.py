class SelectKExtremes(skf.SelectorMixin, skb.BaseEstimator):
    """Transformer for selecting the `k` best or worst assets.

    Keep the `k` best or worst assets according to a given measure.

    Parameters
    ----------
    k : int, default=10
        Number of assets to select. If `k` is higher than the number of assets, all
        assets are selected.

    measure : Measure, default=RatioMeasure.SHARPE_RATIO
        The :ref:`measure <measures_ref>` used to sort the assets.
        The default is `RatioMeasure.SHARPE_RATIO`.

    highest : bool, default=True
        If this is set to True, the `k` assets with the highest `measure` are selected,
        otherwise it is the `k` lowest.

    Attributes
    ----------
    to_keep_ : ndarray of shape (n_assets, )
       Boolean array indicating which assets are remaining.

    n_features_in_ : int
       Number of assets seen during `fit`.

    feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)
       Names of features seen during `fit`. Defined only when `X`
       has feature names that are all strings.
