class DropCorrelated(skf.SelectorMixin, skb.BaseEstimator):
    """Transformer for dropping highly correlated assets.

    Simply removing all correlation pairs above the threshold will remove more assets
    than necessary and a naive sequential removal is suboptimal and depends on the
    initial assets ordering.

    Let's suppose X,Y,Z are three random variables with corr(X,Y) and corr(X,Z) above
    the threshold and corr(Y,Z) below.
    The first approach would remove X,Y,Z and the second approach would remove either
    Y and Z or X depending on the initial ordering.

    To avoid these shortcomings, we implement the below algorithm:

        * Step 1: select all correlation pairs above the threshold.
        * Step 2: sort all the selected correlation pairs from highest to lowest.
        * Step 3: for each pair, if none of the two assets has been removed, keep the
          asset with the lowest average correlation against the other assets.

    Parameters
    ----------
    threshold : float, default=0.95
        Correlation threshold. The default value is `0.95`.

    absolute : bool, default=False
        If this is set to True, we take the absolute value of the correlation. This has
        for effect to also include negatively correlated assets.

    Attributes
    ----------
    to_keep_ : ndarray of shape (n_assets, )
        Boolean array indicating which assets are remaining.

    n_features_in_ : int
        Number of assets seen during `fit`.

    feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)
        Names of assets seen during `fit`. Defined only when `X`
        has assets names that are all strings.
