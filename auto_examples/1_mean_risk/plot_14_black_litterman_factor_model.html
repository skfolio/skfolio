<p>The Black &amp; Litterman Factor Model is a Factor Model in which we incorporate views on
factors using the Black &amp; Litterman Model.</p>
<p>In the previous two tutorials, we introduced the Factor Model and the Black &amp; Litterman
separately. In this tutorial we show how we can merge them together by building a
Maximum Sharpe Ratio portfolio using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">FactorModel</span></code> estimator.</p>

also estimate the factor Momentum will outperform the factor Quality by 2% p.a

<p>The API design makes it possible to created nested models without limits.
In the below example, we re-apply a Black &amp; Litterman model incorporating assets
views. But instead of using the empirical moments, we use the above Black &amp; Litterman
