<p>This tutorial shows how to use the <a class="reference internal" href="../../generated/skfolio.prior.FactorModel.html#skfolio.prior.FactorModel" title="skfolio.prior.FactorModel"><code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">FactorModel</span></code></a> estimator in
the <a class="reference internal" href="../../generated/skfolio.optimization.MeanRisk.html#skfolio.optimization.MeanRisk" title="skfolio.optimization.MeanRisk"><code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MeanRisk</span></code></a> optimization.</p>
<p>A <a class="reference internal" href="../../user_guide/prior.html#prior"><span class="std std-ref">prior estimator</span></a> fits a <a class="reference internal" href="../../generated/skfolio.prior.PriorModel.html#skfolio.prior.PriorModel" title="skfolio.prior.PriorModel"><code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PriorModel</span></code></a> containing
the distribution estimate of asset returns. It represents the investor’s prior beliefs
about the model used to estimate such distribution.</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PriorModel</span></code> is a dataclass containing:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mu</span></code>: Expected returns estimation</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">covariance</span></code>: Covariance matrix estimation</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">returns</span></code>: assets returns estimation</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cholesky</span></code> : Lower-triangular Cholesky factor of the covariance estimation (optional)</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">FactorModel</span></code> estimator estimates the <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PriorModel</span></code> using a factor model and a
<a class="reference internal" href="../../user_guide/prior.html#prior"><span class="std std-ref">prior estimator</span></a> of the factor’s returns. The purpose of factor models is
to impose a structure on financial variables and their covariance matrix by explaining
them through a small number of common factors. This can help overcome estimation
error by reducing the number of parameters, i.e., the dimensionality of the estimation
problem, making portfolio optimization more robust against noise in the data. Factor
models also provide a decomposition of financial risk to systematic and security
specific components.</p>
<p>To be compatible with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">scikit-learn</span></code>, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fit</span></code> method takes <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">X</span></code> as the assets returns
and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">y</span></code> as the factors returns. Note that <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">y</span></code> is in lowercase even for a 2D array
(more than one factor). This is for consistency with the scikit-learn API.</p>
<p>In this tutorial we will build a Maximum Sharpe Ratio portfolio using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">FactorModel</span></code>
estimator.</p>
