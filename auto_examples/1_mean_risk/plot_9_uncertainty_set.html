<p>This tutorial shows how to incorporate expected returns uncertainty sets into the
<a class="reference internal" href="../../generated/skfolio.optimization.MeanRisk.html#skfolio.optimization.MeanRisk" title="skfolio.optimization.MeanRisk"><code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MeanRisk</span></code></a> optimization.</p>
<p>By using the <a class="reference internal" href="../../user_guide/uncertainty_set.html#uncertainty-set-estimator"><span class="std std-ref">Mu Uncertainty set estimator</span></a>,
the assets expected returns are modelled with an ellipsoidal uncertainty set.
This approach, known as worst-case optimization, falls under the umbrella of robust
optimization. It reduces the instability that arises from the estimation errors of the
expected returns.</p>
<p>The worst case portfolio expect return is:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[w^T\hat{\mu} - \kappa_{\mu}\lVert S_{\mu}^\frac{1}{2}w\rVert_{2}\]</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\kappa\)</span> the size of the ellipsoid (confidence region) and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S\)</span> its
shape.</p>
<p>In this example, we will use a Mean-CVaR model with an
<a class="reference internal" href="../../generated/skfolio.uncertainty_set.EmpiricalMuUncertaintySet.html#skfolio.uncertainty_set.EmpiricalMuUncertaintySet" title="skfolio.uncertainty_set.EmpiricalMuUncertaintySet"><code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">EmpiricalMuUncertaintySet</span></code></a> estimator.</p>
<p>Note that other uncertainty set can be used, for example:
<a class="reference internal" href="../../generated/skfolio.uncertainty_set.BootstrapMuUncertaintySet.html#skfolio.uncertainty_set.BootstrapMuUncertaintySet" title="skfolio.uncertainty_set.BootstrapMuUncertaintySet"><code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BootstrapMuUncertaintySet</span></code></a>.</p>

<p>First, we create a Mean-CVaR model to estimate the efficient frontier without
uncertainty set. We constrain the CVaR at 95% to be below 2% (representing the
average loss of the worst 5% daily returns over the period):</p>

<h2>Hyper-Parameter Tuning<a class="headerlink" href="#hyper-parameter-tuning" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>In this section, we consider a 3 months rolling (60 business days) long-short
allocation fitted on the preceding year of data (252 business days) that maximizes the
portfolio return under a CVaR constraint.
We will use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">GridSearchCV</span></code> to select the below model parameters on the training set
using walk forward analysis with a Mean/CVaR ratio scoring.</p>
<p>The model parameters to tune are:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">max_cvar</span></code>: CVaR target (upper constraint)</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cvar_beta</span></code>: CVaR confidence level</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">confidence_level</span></code>: Mu uncertainty set confidence level of the <a class="reference internal" href="../../generated/skfolio.uncertainty_set.EmpiricalMuUncertaintySet.html#skfolio.uncertainty_set.EmpiricalMuUncertaintySet" title="skfolio.uncertainty_set.EmpiricalMuUncertaintySet"><code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">EmpiricalMuUncertaintySet</span></code></a></p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>For embedded parameters in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">GridSearchCV</span></code>, you need to use a double underscore:
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mu_uncertainty_set_estimator__confidence_level</span></code></p>

<p>For continuous parameters, such as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">confidence_level</span></code>, a better approach is to use
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">RandomizedSearchCV</span></code> and specify a continuous distribution to take full advantage of
the randomization. We specify a continuous random variable that is uniformly
distributed between 0 and 1:</p>

<br /><p>From the plot and the below summary, we can see that the model without uncertainty set
is overfitted and perform poorly on the test set. Its CVaR at 95% is 10% and its
Mean/CVaR ratio is 0.006 which is the lowest of all models.</p>
