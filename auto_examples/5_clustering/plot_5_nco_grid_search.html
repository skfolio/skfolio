<h2>Conclusion<a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>This NCO model outperforms the Benchmark in terms of Sharpe Ratio on the historical
test set. However, the distribution analysis on the recombined (non-historical) test
sets shows that it slightly underperforms the Benchmark in average.</p>
<p>This was a toy example to present the API. Further analysis using different
estimators, datasets and CV parameters should be performed to determine if the
outperformance on the historical test set is due to chance or if this NCO model is
able to exploit time-dependencies information lost in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CombinatorialPurgedCV</span></code>.</p>
