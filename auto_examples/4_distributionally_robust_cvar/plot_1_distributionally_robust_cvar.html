<p>This tutorial introduces the <a class="reference internal" href="../../generated/skfolio.optimization.DistributionallyRobustCVaR.html#skfolio.optimization.DistributionallyRobustCVaR" title="skfolio.optimization.DistributionallyRobustCVaR"><code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DistributionallyRobustCVaR</span></code></a>
model.</p>
<p>The Distributionally Robust CVaR model constructs a Wasserstein ball in the space of
multivariate and non-discrete probability distributions centered at the uniform
distribution on the training samples, and find the allocation that minimize the CVaR of
the worst-case distribution within this Wasserstein ball.</p>
<p>Mohajerin Esfahani and Kuhn (2018) proved that for piecewise linear objective functions,
which is the case of CVaR (Rockafellar and Uryasev), the distributionally robust
optimization problem over Wasserstein ball can be reformulated as finite convex
programs.</p>
<p>It’s advised to use a solver that handles a high number of constraints like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Mosek</span></code>.
For accessibility, this example uses the default open source solver <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CLARABEL</span></code>, so to
increase convergence speed, we only use 3 years of data.</p>
<p>The radius of the Wasserstein ball is controlled with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">wasserstein_ball_radius</span></code>
parameter. Increasing the radius will increase the uncertainty about the
distribution, bringing the weights closer to the equal weighted portfolio.</p>
